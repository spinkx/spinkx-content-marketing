On an average you can increase your user engagement by upto 30%, which in return increases your page views by 30% or more, reduces your current bounce rate by 60% and also make you accumulate credit points (to free boost your posts) and money form native ads or affiliate marketing. More page views means more revenue, either form Spinkx Sponsored Content or even Google Adsense.
